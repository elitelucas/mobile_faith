<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Protecting your privacy is a priority for us. Our privacy policy explains how information is collected, used and
    disclosed by FaithSpace with respect to your access and use of FaithSpace’s services, whether through our website
    (located at https://faithspace.app) or FaithSpace’s mobile application (referred to below as “FaithSpace”). This
    Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible
    through our Services. This Privacy Policy is intended to meet requirements in North America, Europe, and other
    jurisdictions. If you have questions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact faithspacepp@gmail.com.</p>
<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us when using FaithSpace, such as when you create an
    account and profile, send or post information or other content to FaithSpace. We collect certain personal
    information, like your name, picture, email address and any other information you provide to us.
    We may also automatically collect certain information when you use FaithSpace, such as your time zone, Internet
    Protocol (IP) address, operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring site and your activity on
    FaithSpace. This information is not treated as personal information unless we combine it with or link it to any of
    the personally identifiable information mentioned above.
    We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies”. These are small files that your
    browser places on your computer. We may use both “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) and
    “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them) to better understand how you interact with
    our services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our services, and to improve our
    services. Most internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its
    options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
</p>
<h2>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</h2>
<p>We use the information collected through FaithSpace for the purposes described below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to provide our services or information you request, develop new products, and to process and complete any
        transactions;</li>
    <li>
        to respond to your emails, submissions, questions, comments, requests, and complaints and provide customer
        service;
    </li>
    <li>to monitor and analyze usage and trends, and to personalize and improve FaithSpace and your experiences when you

    </li>
    <li>to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages and otherwise

    <li>for any other purpose for which the information was collected.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The information we collect may be “personally identifiable” (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a
    unique person) or “non-personally identifiable” (meaning it can’t be used to specifically identify you). We may use
    or store information wherever we do business.
</p>
<h2>What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?
</h2>
<p>We will not share the personal information we have collected from you, except as described below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>with service providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of our site or our services
        (these service providers have access to your personal information only to perform services on our behalf and are
        obligated not to disclose it or use it for any other purposes and are subject to compliance with this Privacy
        Policy);
    </li>
    <li>with third-Party Payment Processing platforms who sell subscriptions or merchandise through our Services. When
        you make purchases through the Services, we process your payments through a third party application, including
        the Apple App Store (together with any similar applications, “App Stores”) and other third-party payment
        processors, including Stripe. The third party application may collect certain financial information from you to
        process a payment on behalf of FaithSpace, including your name, email address, address and other billing
        information.
    </li>
    <li>we may share aggregated information and non-identifiable information with third parties or partners for industry
        analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes;
    </li>
    <li>when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you that the information you provide will be
        shared in a particular manner and you provide such information;
    </li>
    <li>when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is
        reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, regulation or legal processes or in response to
        lawful requests or legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants or court orders;
    </li>
    <li>to enforce or apply our privacy policy, our terms of use or our other policies or agreements; and
    </li>
    <li>in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, bankruptcy, dissolution,
        reorganization, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where personal information may be disclosed
        or transferred as one of our business assets.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We are not responsible for the actions of service providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any
    additional information you provide directly to any third parties.
</p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>FaithSpace may contain links to other third-party sites. Any information that you provide on a third party site is
    provided directly to the owner of that site and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Our privacy policy does
    not apply to such sites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies
    of those third party sites</p>
<h2>What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information Online?</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and
    unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no
    security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any
    interception or other type of misuse.</p>
<h2>Accessing and Modifying Your Information</h2>
<p>If you have an account, you can access and modify the personal information you provided us that is associated with
    your account. You may “opt out” of receiving messages from specific users. If you opt out of these messages, you
    will still receive emails from us, about your account, our services and other pertinent information related to our
    services. These communications are considered part of the service and your account, which you cannot opt-out from
    receiving.
    If you want to deactivate or delete your information and your account, please contact us at faithspaceapp@gmail.com
    with a request that we delete your account and information. We will take steps to delete your information as soon as
    we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records and as otherwise required by law.
</p>
<h2>Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction
</h2>
<p>You may ask if FaithSpace is processing personal information about you, request access to your personal information,
    and ask that we correct, amend or delete your personal information. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you
    may contact us at faithspaceapp@gmail.com. Please include your full name, send the request from the email address
    associated with your Account (or provide another mechanism for us to verify your identity), and include a detailed
    description of your data request. We will process such requests in line with local laws.
    Although FaithSpace makes good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information, there may be
    circumstances when we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to situations where the requested
    information has legal privilege, would compromise the privacy of others or other legitimate rights, where the burden
    or expense of providing access would greatly exceed the risk to your privacy. If we determine that your access
    should be limited after a request is made, we will give an explanation of how that determination was made and a
    contact for follow up.
</p>
<h2>Our Policy Toward Children</h2>
<p>Our service is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children
    under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete
    such information from our files as soon as possible. If you are under the age of 18, you must have your parent’s
    permission to access the Services.
</p>
<h2>
    Changes
</h2>
<p>Any information that is collected is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is
    collected. We may, however, modify and revise our privacy policy from time-to-time. If we make any material changes
    to this policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting them on FaithSpace or by sending you an email or other
    notification, and we will indicate when such changes will become effective. By continuing to access or use
    FaithSpace after those changes become effective, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised policy.

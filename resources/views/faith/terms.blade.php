    items that are offered for sale through the Services (the “Products”), as described in further detail under the
    Section titled “Purchases” below.
    You understand and agree that the Services, Products and any other information you learn from FaithSpace are not
    intended, designed, or implied to diagnose, prevent, or treat any condition or disease, to ascertain the state of
    your health, or to be a substitute for professional medical care. Not all activities described in the Services or
    Products are suitable for everyone. Do not use the Services while driving, operating heavy machinery, or performing
    other tasks that require attention and concentration. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for
    your use of the Services.
</p>
<h2>Purchases</h2>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>FaithSpace offers certain enhanced features of the Services which you can purchase as a monthly, yearly or lifetime
    subscription (“Subscription”). A description of features associated with Subscriptions is available via the
    Services. When you purchase a Subscription or a Product (each, a “Transaction”), we may ask you to supply additional
    information relevant to your Transaction, such as your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card
    and your address(es) for billing and delivery (such information, “Payment Information”). You represent and warrant
    that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. The amounts
    due and payable by you for a Transaction through the Services will be presented to you before you place your order.
    If you choose to initiate a Transaction via the Services, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to
    third party service providers so we can complete your Transaction and agree (a) to pay the applicable fees and any
    taxes; (b) that FaithSpace may charge your credit card or third party payment processing account, including, but not
    limited to, your account with the app store or distribution platform (like the Apple App Store, Google Play or the
    Amazon Appstore) where the App is made available (each, an “App Provider”), for verification, pre-authorization and
    payment purposes; and (c) to bear any additional charges that your App Provider, bank or other financial service
    provider may levy on you as well as any taxes or fees that may apply to your order. Your order is not binding on
    FaithSpace until accepted and confirmed by FaithSpace. All payments made are non-refundable and non-transferable
    except as expressly provided in these Terms.
    If you have any concerns or objections regarding charges, you agree to raise them with us first and you agree not to
    cancel or reject any credit card or third party payment processing charges unless you have made a reasonable attempt
    at resolving the matter directly with FaithSpace.
    FaithSpace reserves the right to not process or to cancel your order in certain circumstances, for example, if your
    credit card is declined, if we suspect the request or order is fraudulent, or in other circumstances FaithSpace
    deems appropriate in its sole discretion. FaithSpace also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps
    to verify your identity in connection with your order. You may need to provide additional information to verify your
    identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment
    Information). FaithSpace will either not charge you or refund the charges for orders that we do not process or
    cancel.
    We may at any time and from time to time, in our sole discretion, change the fees and charges, or add new fees and
    charges, in relation to any of the Products or Services. We will notify you at least 30 calendar days in advance of
    any such change. If you do not agree to the change, you may cancel your membership or subscription in your account
    settings or by emailing faithspaceapp@gmail.com.
</p>
<h3>Return Policy</h3>
<p>If for any reason, you are not satisfied with the Product you have purchased and you want to return the Product,
    please contact faithspaceapp@gmail.com for information on how you may return eligible Products.
</p>
<h3>Subscriptions Automatically Renew Until You Cancel & How to Cancel Your Subscription</h3>
<p>All amounts are payable and charged: (i) for one-off purchase (e.g. lifetime Subscription), at the time you place
    your order; and (ii) For monthly or yearly subscriptions, at the beginning of the subscription and, because each
    such subscription renews automatically for an additional period equal in length to the expiring subscription term
    until you cancel it, at the time of each renewal until you cancel, using the Payment Information you have provided.
    You must cancel your monthly or yearly Subscription before it renews to avoid the billing of the fees for the next
    Subscription period. If you purchase your Subscription via the Site, you can cancel the renewal of your subscription
    at any time by contacting us by email at faithspaceapp@gmail.com. If you purchase your Subscription via an App
    Provider, you can cancel the renewal of your subscription with the App Provider. You will not receive a refund for
    the fees you already paid for your current subscription period and you will continue to receive the Services ordered
    until the end of your current Subscription period.
</p>
<h3>Changes to Price Terms for Subscriptions</h3>
<p>FaithSpace reserves the right to change its pricing terms for Subscriptions at any time and FaithSpace will notify
    you in advance of such changes becoming effective. Changes to the pricing terms will not apply retroactively and
    will only apply for Subscription renewals after such changed pricing terms have been communicated to you. If you do
    not agree with the changes to FaithSpace’s pricing terms then you may choose not to renew your Subscription in
    accordance with the section “Subscriptions Automatically Renew Until You Cancel & How to Cancel Your Subscription.”
</p>
<h3>Future Functionality</h3>
<p>You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or
    dependent on any oral or written public comments made by FaithSpace regarding future functionality or features.</p>
<h3>Gift Subscriptions</h3>
<p>“Gift Subscriptions” are pre-paid memberships to the Products. A person who purchases the gift is referred to in
    these terms as the “Giftor”. A person who receives and redeems a Gift Subscription to the Products is referred to in
    these terms as the “Recipient”. Gift subscriptions are paid for as a one-off upfront payment. Once bought, the
    Giftor will receive an Order confirmation and receipt. The FaithSpace gift subscription will be sent to the
    Recipient on the Giftor’s specified date. Gifting codes can only be used once in the country for which they were
    purchased and cannot be redeemed for cash, resold or combined with any other offers, including free trial. Please
    note that gifting codes cannot be redeemed if the Recipient has already purchased a subscription through the Apple
    iTunes Store or our iPhone application, or other application store service. We will automatically bill the Payment
    Method you provided for any purchased Gift Subscriptions at the time of purchase, not delivery. There are no refunds
    or other credits for Gift Subscription that are not redeemed. FaithSpace will notify the Recipient prior to the end
    of the Gift Subscription that the gift period is about to expire. FaithSpace is not responsible if a Gift
    Subscription is lost, stolen or used without permission.
</p>
<h2>Promotion Codes</h2>
<p>Any promotion code or offer provided by us may not be used in conjunction with any other promotion code or offer,
    past or present. Introductory offers are only available to new users of the Products, except where expressly stated
    otherwise. Previous users or trial users of the Products do not qualify as new users. No promotion code or discount
    will apply to corporate or other subscriptions. Unless otherwise set forth in the terms of any promotion, all
    pricing promotions or discounts will apply to the initial period of the subscription, and any renewals will be
    charged at the rate in effect at the time of renewal for the type of subscription purchased.

<h2>Limitations; Indemnity; Waiver of Liability</h2>
<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FAITHSPACE, MICHAEL REALE, AND ITS AFFILIATE ENTITIES ARE NOT LIABLE
    (1) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
    GOODWILL, OR DATA, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES; OR
    (2) FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES AND OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL SITES.
    THE RISK OF USING THE SERVICES AND EXTERNAL SITES RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU AS DOES THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE
    SERVICES AND EXTERNAL SITES.
    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY ANY LAW THAT APPLIES, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY IN THESE TERMS APPLY TO ALL
    DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY THE SERVICES, OR RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, UNDER ANY CAUSE
    OF ACTION IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR
    TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE).
    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF FAITHSPACE, MICHAEL REALE, AND ITS
    AFFILIATE ENTITIES IS LIMITED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID FAITHSPACE, MICHAEL REALE, AND/ OR ITS AFFILIATE
    ENTITIES FOR USE OF THE SERVICES, PRODUCTS OR USER CONTENT IN THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS (180) DAYS IMMEDIATELY
    PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM.
    IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID FAITHSPACE, MICHAEL REALE, AND/OR ITS AFFILIATE ENTITIES ANY AMOUNT IN THE ONE HUNDRED AND
    EIGHTY DAYS (180) DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM, YOUR SOLE AND
    EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH FAITHSPACE, MICHAEL REALE, AND/OR ANY AFFILIATE ENTITIES IS TO STOP USING THE
    SERVICES AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.
    Some states or countries do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitations/exclusions of liability
    described above, which means these limitations/exclusions may not apply to you if you reside in one of those states
    or countries.
    These limitations/exclusions do not apply to users located in the EEA. For those users, if FaithSpace fails to
    comply with these Terms, FaithSpace is responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of
    FaithSpace’s breach of these Terms or is a result of FaithSpace’s negligence, but FaithSpace is not responsible for
    any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of our
    breach or if it was contemplated by you and FaithSpace at the time we entered into these Terms.
    You will indemnify and hold harmless FaithSpace and its officers, directors, employee and agents, from and against
    any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
    reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the
    Services or User Content or (ii) your violation of these Terms.
</p>
<h2>Dispute Resolution; Class Action Waiver
</h2>
<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without
    regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
</p>
<h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
<p>You and FaithSpace agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
    breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services, Products or Content
    (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to
    bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of
    competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s
    copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the
    foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the
    right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide FaithSpace with written notice of your desire to do so by email
    at faithspaceapp@gmail.com within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an
    “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you don’t provide FaithSpace with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty
    (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute
    except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP
    Protection Action or, if you timely provide FaithSpace with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and
    federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waive any objection to
    jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide FaithSpace with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you
    acknowledge and agree that you and FaithSpace are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a
    plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and
    FaithSpace otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not
    otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held
    unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the
    preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
</p>
<h3>Arbitration Rules</h3>
<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the
    Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then
    in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at
    www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the
    interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
</p>
<h3>Arbitration Process</h3>
<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as
    specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration form and a separate form for Demand
    for Arbitration for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to
    practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to
    agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint
    the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<h3>Arbitration Location and Procedure</h3>
<p>Unless you and FaithSpace otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your
    claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you
    and FaithSpace submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is
    necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to
    the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the
    parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
</p>
<h3>Arbitrator’s Decision</h3>
<p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will
    include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the
    arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be
    consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for
    which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
    claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you
    prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided
    under applicable law. FaithSpace will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to
    recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA
    Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, FaithSpace will pay all such fees unless the
    arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was
    frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
    Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if FaithSpace changes this “Dispute Resolution”
    section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may
    reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to faithspaceapp@gmail.com within 30 days of
    the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of FaithSpace’s
    email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any
    Dispute between you and FaithSpace in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the
    date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
</p>
<h2>General Terms</h2>
<p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between FaithSpace and you regarding the
    Services, Products and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written
    understandings or agreements between FaithSpace and you regarding the Services, Products and Content. If any
    provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms
    of the “Arbitration” section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of
    arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that
    provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in
    full force and effect.
    You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without FaithSpace’s prior written
    consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.
    FaithSpace may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will
    bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
    Any notices or other communications provided by FaithSpace under these Terms, including those regarding
    modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) by FaithSpace via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For
    notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
    FaithSpace’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right
    or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly
    authorized representative of FaithSpace. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party
    of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or
    otherwise.
</p>
<h2>Choice of Law</h2>
<p>Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of Pennsylvania, other than its
    conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their
    subject matter, including tort claims.</p>
<h2>Force Majeure</h2>
<p>We will not be liable to you for any lack of performance, or the unavailability or failure, of the Products, or for
    any failure or delay by us to comply with these Terms, where such lack, unavailability or failure arises from any
    cause beyond our reasonable control.
</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>We may give our rights, or our obligations, under these Terms to any person or entity at any time with or without
    your consent. You may not give your rights or your obligations under these Terms to anyone without first getting
    FaithSpace’s written consent, and any attempt to do so without our consent is void.
</p>
<h2>Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not
    affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    <br>These Terms are effective and were last updated on April 11, 2021
